# Ideas

Ideas what we might want to do:

* Convenient way to light up only certain areas of the stage
  * "Paint" areas that will be lit
  * "painting" could also do the colors?
* Convenient way to put individuals into spotlight
* Save current light setting on the fly so we can use it again, the next time the same scene occurs
* On-the-fly complimentary color change for outside narration and freezes

* Chase-Sequences
  * (like the lights at 'who wants to be a millionaire', whenever a new question is posed)
  * imagine a car driving forwards on a street guided by street lamps now and then, we could visualize the passing streetlights using a special chase sequence on the lamps, starting with the LEDs in the front, moving the light backwards (kind of like dolby atmos, but for light)
  * Sequences can change their speed to match music or other speed(s)
  * Can we visualize a day/night cycle through DMX?

* Use virtual light sources in relation to the stage that gets transmitted to the actual lights ( like dolby atmos, but for light?)
*
